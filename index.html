          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The most conspicuous correlation is between Median Household Income and the three health risks we've charted.
            The lower the median household income, the greater the risk of obesity, smoking, and a general lack of healthcare. Being
            in poverty is similarly if not as tightly correlated to these risks. This could be explained by Medicaid and other government
            programs set in place to bridge the gap in care for those below a certain income threshold.
          </p>

          <p>An outlier in this data is Texas, where people of lower income but who are not in poverty are disporportionaly at risk of becoming obese,
             smoking, and not having access to healthcare.  The outlier in the opposite direction is DC, where even those who are in poverty are not deprived
             of healthcare at the same rate as many other states"</p>

          <p>Texas and DC also diverge in terms of access to healthcare relative to age. Both have a median age of about 34 where DC only has
            about 8% lacking healthcare and Texas has nearly a quarter of its population without healthcare.
